# ESPHome-DeskPi-Fan-Controller
The ESPHome-DeskPi-Fan-Controller was built gor a very specific purpose. To limit the noise while keeping the DeskPi rack cooled to a set temperature. 

My minilab is located in the bedroom and tucked away in such a way that I need good airflow at the lowest possible noise. To achive this i decided to use ESPHome to control a few 5V fans which can be mounted in the vented blanks available.
